# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your modern portfolio to GitHub Pages, overwriting your existing deployment with the updated code.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [x] Node.js and npm installed
- [x] Git repository set up
- [x] GitHub account with repository access

## 🎯 Quick Deployment (Manual)

### Method 1: Using npm script (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Build and deploy in one command
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
- Build your React app
- Deploy to the `gh-pages` branch
- Automatically update your GitHub Pages site

### Method 2: Step by step

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
npx gh-pages -d build
```

## 🤖 Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up that will automatically deploy your site when you push to the main branch.

### To enable automatic deployment:

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment with modern UI"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - Save the settings

3. **The workflow will automatically:**
   - Run tests
   - Build the project
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Update your live site at: `https://yasirunk9612.github.io/my-portfolio`

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Package.json Updates
- ✅ Added `homepage` URL for GitHub Pages
- ✅ Deploy scripts configured
- ✅ gh-pages dependency installed

### Router Configuration
- ✅ Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for GitHub Pages compatibility
- ✅ Added 404.html for proper routing support

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Automated testing and building
- ✅ Deployment to GitHub Pages
- ✅ Concurrent deployment protection

## 🌐 Your Live Site

After deployment, your portfolio will be available at:
**https://yasirunk9612.github.io/my-portfolio**

## 🔄 Updating Your Site

To update your deployed site with new changes:

1. Make your changes locally
2. Test them: `npm start`
3. Deploy: `npm run deploy`

Or simply push to the main branch for automatic deployment via GitHub Actions.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that your repository name matches the homepage URL
2. Ensure you have push permissions to the repository
3. Verify that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### If routing doesn't work:
1. Ensure you're using HashRouter (already configured)
2. Check that 404.html is in the public folder (already added)

### If styles are missing:
1. Verify the homepage URL in package.json matches your GitHub Pages URL
2. Clear browser cache and reload
